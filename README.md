# Tachograph
The tacograph project is implemented using the clean architecture. 
Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns and the independence of frameworks, databases, and external details from the core business logic.
The project structure has 
1. Data Simulation (C# - .NET Core Console App):Tachograph Simulator, backend PostgresSql
2. Two As.Net Web api services - one to fetch data from postgresdb and another from dynamodb
3. The ASP.net core react project as the web UI.
